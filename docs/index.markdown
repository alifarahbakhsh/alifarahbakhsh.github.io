# About

I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Cornell University, also minoring in political thought. I work on systems, and I am advised by [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/)
and [Robbert Van Renesse](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/). You can find me playing and making music, climbing rocks, shooting basketballs, and hanging out with friends on the lovely evenings of Ithaca.

# Research Interests

My research projects address the age-old question of computer systems: **_how can we build reliable and efficient systems?_** I always look for first principles, and pursue theory and practice in tandem; a sound theoretical basis leads to principled design of practical tools and systems, which in turn inform and enrich the theoretical basis by generating insightful empirical observations.

I am currently working on **_metastable failures_**, wherein a trigger pushes a system into a self-sustaining bad mode of behavior. Metastable failures have been occurring more and more frequently, and yet are still obscure; we do not have a fundamental understanding of how they arise and why they are very difficult to detect, diagnose, and avoid. I am developing a **_sound and simple characterization_** of these failures. Such a basis is immaterial for identifying key design and operation principles, which are crucial for large-scale compute providers experiencing metastable failures. I am also building tools, including a **_domain-specific language called Nimbus_**, to reproduce empirical incidents of metastability in a controlled environment, and to look for metastability using a simple yet rich set of abstractions. This project is a collaboration with [Robbert Van Renesse](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/), [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/), [Andreas Haeberlen](https://haeberlen.cis.upenn.edu/), and [Shir Cohen Gahtan](https://sites.google.com/view/shircohen).

I also pursue research on developing **_fast and secure consensus protocols_** for the **_permissionless model_** of Bitcoin. Permissionless systems have posed decentralized computing as a feasible paradigm complementing the current centralized status quo. They suffer, however, from shortcomings in performance and security. This stems from coupling performance to security. Following recent advances, we decouple them by providing **_deterministic safety_**, using the traditional quorum intersection methods. Albeit still experimental, our protocols promise further avenues to pursue provably high performance, ultimately paving the way for a practical, safe, and fast ordering layer for decentralized computing. This project is a collaboration with [Youer Pu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youer-pu-52ab5486/), [Giuliano Losa](https://www.losa.fr/), [Ittay Eyal](https://ittayeyal.github.io/), and [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/).
